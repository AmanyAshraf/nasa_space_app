    <string name="info_desc">The Carrington Event was the most intense geomagnetic storm in recorded history, peaking from 1
to 2 September 1859 during the solar cycle. It created strong auroral displays that were reported
globally and caused sparking and even fires in multiple telegraph stations. The geomagnetic storm
was most likely the result of a coronal mass ejection from the Sun colliding with Earth\'s
magnetosphere.
The geomagnetic storm was associated with a very bright solar flare on 1 September 1859. It was
observed and recorded independently by British astronomers Richard Christopher Carrington and
Richard Hodgson.
A geomagnetic storm of this magnitude occurring today would cause widespread electrical
disruptions, blackouts, and damage due to extended outages of the electrical power grid.</string>
